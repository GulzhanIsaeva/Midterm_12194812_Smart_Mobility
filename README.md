## What is ROS (foxy)?


The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.



## During the September and October I learned how:


-to use turtlesim along with rqt
