# Managing Dependencies with rosdep

## What is rosdep?

**rosdep** is ROSâ€™s dependency management utility that can work with ROS packages and external libraries. rosdep is a command-line utility for identifying and installing dependencies to build or install a package. 

## How does rosdep work?

**rosdep** will check for package.xml files in its path or for a specific package and find the rosdep keys stored within. Once the packages are found, they are installed and ready to go!

## How do I use the rosdep tool?

Firstly, we must be initialize **rosdep**

```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

This will initialize rosdep and update will update the locally cached rosdistro index.

Now, we can run rosdep install to install dependencies

```
rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src
```

# Creating an action

- Source your ROS2 installations
- Go to ros2_ws/src workspace
- Create a package named **action_tutorials_interfaces**

```
cd ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create action_tutorials_interfaces
```

## Defining an action

Actions are defined in .action files of the form:
```
# Request
---
# Result
---
# Feedback
```

An action definition is made up of three message definitions separated by ---.


- A request message is sent from an action client to an action server initiating a new goal.
- A result message is sent from an action server to an action client when a goal is done.
- Feedback messages are periodically sent from an action server to an action client with updates about a goal.

-

Create an action directory in action_tutorials_interfaces:

```
cd action_tutorials_interfaces
mkdir action
```

In the action directory, create a file called Fibonacci.action:

```
int32 order # goal request
---
int32[] sequence # final result
---
int32[] partial_sequence # feedback
```
